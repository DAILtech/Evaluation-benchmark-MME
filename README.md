## Clone the Required Repositories for MME Evaluation Benchmark

To streamline the use of the MME Benchmark, we have consolidated all the necessary repositories and configured them for one-button deployment. Follow the steps below to get started.

### Step 1: Directory Setup

Begin by creating the required directory structure inside your LLaVA workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p LLaVA/playground/data/eval/MME
```

This ensures all evaluation data is well-organized. We strongly recommend placing the `MME` folder inside eval for better clarity and separation.

### Step 2: Clone the MME Evaluation Benchmark

Now, clone the benchmark repository:\  
```
git clone https://github.com/DAILtech/Evaluation-benchmark-MME/
```
This repository contains everything needed for running the MME Benchmark in one go.
